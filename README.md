# Project Name

Description:
This project utilizes an LSTM architecture to perform next text generation. The dataset used is obtained from Kaggle. The purpose of this project is to generate next word for input text data.

## Dataset:
The dataset used in this project is sourced from Kaggle. It contains reviews along with their corresponding summaries. You can find the dataset on Kaggle 
## Architecture:
The model architecture utilized for text summarization is LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory). LSTM is a type of recurrent neural network (RNN) that is well-suited for sequence data processing tasks.
